In a vast majority of cases, if one can't organize, schedule and accomplish the things one needs to do in an "8 hour day" on a consistent basis then consider one of two possibilities: (1) The individual is not all that "good" at their job and/or wastes a lot of time during the work day (2) There's too much work for the number of people employed. Any operation where "overtime" is chronic as opposed to occasional, the operation more likely than not is being mismanaged
